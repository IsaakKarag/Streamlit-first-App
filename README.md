### Check my app [here](https://isaakkarag-streamlit-first-app-app-4-d3rel3.streamlitapp.com/)

This is my first Streamlit Web Application for developers salary prediction across Europe based on stackoverflow's survey dataset regarding 2021. The app was deployed on Streamlit's cloud service.

I chose to create this project from scratch as part of my MSc degree in Data Science dissertation/thesis. 


After having tested a few models, the best performance was from GradientBoostingRegressor prediction model which is chosen for the implementation. 

The salary range was $10000 - $250000

Scores: 

Root Mean Squared Error: $22650.03

Mean Absolute Percentage Error: 27%

R squared: 0.51

Due to the limited records of some small countries the predictions on them might be invalid.  

You can navigate through "Explore or Predict" drop-down in order to explore the respective visualizations!
