This is my first Streamlit Web Application for salary prediction in IT sector across Europe based on stackoverflow's dataset regarding 2021.

I chose to create this project from scratch as part of my MSc degree in Data Science dissertation/thesis. 


After having tested a few models, the best performance was from GradientBoostingRegressor prediction model which is choosen for the implementation.
