This is my first Streamlit Web Application for developers salary prediction across Europe based on stackoverflow's survey dataset regarding 2021.

I chose to create this project from scratch as part of my MSc degree in Data Science dissertation/thesis. 


After having tested a few models, the best performance was from GradientBoostingRegressor prediction model which is chosen for the implementation.
