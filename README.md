This is my first Streamlit Web Application for developers salary prediction across Europe based on stackoverflow's survey dataset regarding 2021.

I chose to create this project from scratch as part of my MSc degree in Data Science dissertation/thesis. 


After having tested a few models, the best performance was from GradientBoostingRegressor prediction model which is chosen for the implementation. 

The salary range was $10000 - $250000

Scores: 

Root Mean Squared Error: $22650.03

Mean Absolut Percentage Error: 27%

R squared: 0.51

Due to the limited records of some small countries the predictions on them might be invalid.  

You can navigate through "Explore or Predict" dropdown in order to explore the respective visualizations!
